Additional notes (multi-line):
- Sticker says "intel pentium inside", i don't know how to lscpu in haiku yet.
- SD Reader doesn't work, no fingerprint.
- Machine didn't like Haiku on DVD but loved it on USB - maybe media or drive problem.
- VERY fast and responsive.
- Machine had crash/OOM under Windows 7.
- Apart from the SSD thing and the camera EVERYTHING works.
- Did not need any special bios option or wacky install.
- Is loaded into grub (grub needed special configuration but is otherwise OK)...
- All in all it's a dream, and this computer was free so that's great.
- SD host is JMicron Technology Corp 197b:2381 and webcam is Chicony ERlectronics Co HP Webcam ver 8242 (04f2:>b187)
- The webcam might be a vuc device? i don't know anything about it, or care that it isn't working at the moment.
