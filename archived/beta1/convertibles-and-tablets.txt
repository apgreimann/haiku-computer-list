Additional notes: Touchpad only works in the large area for left click; the smaller areas for left and right click do not work. It also appears that the function keys on the keyboard which control the volume, screen brightness, etc. don't work either. Built in webcam non functional, brief test with a generic action camera in webcam mode didn't work either.
