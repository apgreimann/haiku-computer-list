Additional comments (multi-line):
    Preinstall Haiku 64-bit on a compatible PC, then put it inside the Mac.
    AirPort (WiFi) does not work under Haiku; Ethernet works great.
    Sound does not work; tested with speakers and audio out.
    Key and screen brightness do not work.
    Resolution was set at 1152x768.

Apple MacBook Pro 15" 2.2GHz Mid-2007 (MacBookPro3,1)
Rating: Somewhat okay (i.e. the display works, but there's no sound or mouse)
Version: Haiku R1 Beta 1 (32-bit)
Startup media: Internal SSD or hard drive (imaged or installed)
Started with: I do not know what this means
Boot options: Tried boot options
Memory: 6GB
CPU: Intel Core 2 Duo 2.2GHz (probably T7500 "Merom")
GPU: NVIDIA GeForce 8600M GT with 128MB
Additional notes (multi-line):
    Does not boot Haiku from USB, you need to use a DVD drive or extract the disk and use another computer to install Haiku onto it. In my case, I must have screwed the boot loader stuff by having two SSDs with multiple partitions, so I ended up using a secondary SSD with an Haiku R1/Beta 1 32bit install image (written using dd) to boot the system (by pressing ALT and then choosing `Windows`) and the main drive to hold the partitions for both macOS and Haiku.
    Sometimes, it requires two or three attempts before booting successfully, and turning on or off some boot options may help, but I could not find a pattern that would work every single time. Sometimes, the boot process seems to be frozen at the first icon, until I take out the cable of a USB mouse, then it boots. 
    It uses VESA Graphics on the full internal display resolution and Wifi works OK.
    Sometimes, though, it looses wifi connection and can only get back online by rebooting the system.
    Audio output did not work in the beta, but if you update to a recent (64bit) nightly build, you can get loud audio output on earphones or external speakers.
    The internal trackpad seems to be a bit ""nervous"", clicking in small targets may be a challenge, and there is no secondary button nor scroll. Using an external USB mouse worked perfectly.
    There is no iSight camera, but I believe the internal microphone works.
    Keyboard layout for my language (Portuguese) is a work in progress, as there are some keys that need to be reconfigured.
    There is no keyboard backlight. The system is very stable overall.
    I did see a few kernel panics occasionally, but I have been able to work for long hours without any problems.

ThinkPad T440P (Quad-core i7, 16GB of RAM, GeForce GT 730 @ 900p resolution)
Rating: Good (nearly everything works; e.g. the display, audio, ports, peripherals work, but no Wifi)

Additional notes (multi-line):
    Added note for 900p per request on the Haiku forum.
    Wireless gets stuck on ‘Connecting’ after closing and opening the lid. A restart fixes it, but that's not opimal, so I'll provide any debugging help that's needed for developers.
    Right click does not work with the stock touchpad.
    Also, I have not tested the DVD drive.
