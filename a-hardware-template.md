This is an example of how hardware should be listed on the [Computers compatible with Haiku](https://discuss.haiku-os.org/t/computers-compatible-with-haiku-v3/7640)

* For category or **form factor**, please list if your computer should be filed under:
All-in-One Desktops, General-purpose laptops/portables, Tablets/Convertibles, Notebooks,
