Additional notes: Bluetooth is not recognized, hdmi does not work. Audio need to perform better (Not so loud and round like the one on Windows/Linux), but overall it is a good experience :) Otter perform well with youtube, there is not so much flickering and tearing, it is a lot usable, apps like the pager crash sometimes.

Lenovo x140e Type 20BL-S00900
Rating: Excellent (everything works... except maybe the camera or fingerprint reader)
Version: Haiku R1 Beta 1 (32-bit)
Startup media: Internal SSD or hard drive (imaged or installed); USB media
Started with: Legacy BIOS
Memory: 8GB
CPU: AMD A4-5000
GPU: Radeon HD 8330
Sound card: HD Audio - Realtek ALC3202
Networking card: Intel 7260AC FRU:04W3814 
Additional notes (multi-line):
  Comes with a Windows 8 Pro license embedded useually.
  use this to update the BIOS, so you can install the upgraded wifi card that works with Haiku.
  USB bot works, installing to SATA SSD/HDD works.
  Except for ACPI Buttons/backlight control etc.. 100% functional once the wifi is swapped.
  Browsers are usable but a little laggy, native and QT apps run well though on this 1.5Ghz quad core.

Lenovo x131e
Rating: Excellent (everything works... except maybe the camera or fingerprint reader)
Version: Haiku R1 Beta 1 (64-bit)
Startup media: Internal SSD or hard drive (imaged or installed); USB media
Started with: EFI on (by choice)
Memory: 8GB
CPU: AMD E2-1800 1.7Ghz dual core
GPU: Radeon HD 7340
Sound card: HD Audio - Realtek ALC3202
Networking card: Realtek RTL8188CE (works with UEFI only must disable CSM)
Additional notes (multi-line):
  The WiFi is the catching point on this one, it only ever worked for me with CSM disabled in the BIOS.
  the x140e + upgraded BIOS + swapped to intel wifi is a much better laptop.
  If you get one of these cheap it's nice though only a dual core.
  Also I've ran 16GB of ram in these, the x140e probably supports 32GB.
