Asrock Fata1ity gaming/ITX board
Rating: Good (nearly everything works; e.g. the display, audio, ports, peripherals work, but no Wifi)
Version: Haiku R1 Beta 1
CPU: Ryzen 1700x
GPU: Vega FE
Memory: 16GB ram
Additional notes: only boots with 4GB limit enabled in bootloader + failsafe video, its rediculously fast though for a Haiku box. Built in Wifi works as it’s a compatible intel chipset, ethernet works.

Additional notes (multi-line):
- Both UEFI and Legacy bios work after switching PCI-E support to gen 2 instead of gen 3.
- Set video OpROM to UEFI only when using UEFI to use the native screen resolution.
- C602 SATA SCU doesn't work, AHCI controller works;
- S/PDIF of build in sound card doesn't show up in media, analog works great;
- Xonar HDAV (C-Media CMI8788) no sound with or without OSS;
- Aqua Computer kryoM.2 evo (with a Samsung 960 EVO) doesn't show up;
- PS/2, RS232, and Firewire untested
- Everything else works!
