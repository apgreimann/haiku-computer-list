Model: [Acer] Aspire V7-482PG
Rating: Works amazingly well
Version: Haiku R1/beta2 (quick edit, the 64-bit version)
Startup media: USB storage media (USB 2)
Started with: Legacy BIOS and UEFI
Boot options: Default on BIOS, 1280x1024 resolution on UEFI, the default of 1920x1080 crashes
CPU: Intel Core i5-4200U
GPU: Intel HD 4400 and Nvidia GeForce GT 750M
Sound cards: Intel (Haswell-ULT) HDA Controller
Networking cards: Intel Corporation Wireless 7260 (works, I’m using it to post this from Haiku) and Realtek RTL8111/8168/8411 PCI Express Gigabit Ethernet (not tested but should work, Haiku displays its MAC address, mine is the RTL8411B)
USB types: 1 USB 3.2, 2 USB 2.0
Webcams: Chicony Electronics HD WebCam, not recognized, not working
Memory: 8 GB DDR3
CPU manufacturer: Intel
Share on GitHub: Yes
SD cards: RTL8411B PCI Express Card Reader (PCI Express link bandwidth shared with Ethernet controller), not working
Sound status: I can change the volume, sound card is recognized but sound doesn’t play
Networking status: WiFi works, Ethernet is recognized but I can’t test it
Graphics status: Work out of the box
Power status: Battery appears, PowerStatus reports percentage fine
Restarting: Works fine
Additional notes:
- Touchpad doesn’t recognize right click (workaround: configure as 1 button touchpad and use ctrl+click to right click), edge scroll works well. The right click problem happens with other laptops too, all Synaptics touchpads, seems like a limitation in the driver
- Elan Microelectronics touch screen works! Haiku only uses the touch info to move the cursor though, I can’t find a way to “click”
- HDMI port not tested
- UEFI boot requires more testing, when I tried it last week it caused glitched graphics and Haiku was unusable
- The 24GB M-pcie SSD (Kingston SMS151S324G) is recognized by DriveSetup
- The HDD of this laptop was replaced with a 250G Samsung SSD that is also recognized by DriveSetup
- The mic doesn’t seem to be working, SoundRecorder doesn’t record anything
- Bluetooth works and can pair
- This laptop is a great candidate for using Haiku on real hardware if you don’t need sound or recording video

Additional notes: Could not boot to a  written Haiku setup from an USB flash drive (BIOS doesn't recognize it as bootable), but booting from CD works. The notebook doesn't have a battery plugged in (and I don't have it), but recognizes it as having a bad battery. Wifi is unstable, but useable with some patience.
