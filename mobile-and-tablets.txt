Additional notes (multi-line):
- Battery applet sometimes does not start into deskbar and does not show infos, sometimes works
- Touchscreen does not work
- Screen resolution ok, but I'm pretty sure that I saw "Braswell" once (in the screen settings), maybe an earlier revision?
- Touchpad keys do not work
- Did not try hdmi output; headset jack output works
