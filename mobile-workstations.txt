Apple MacBook Pro (Mid 2012)
Version: Haiku Nightly (April 2019)
Startup media: USB flash drive
Contributor: sneaky
Contribution date: 22 April 2019
Additional notes (multi-line):
- Aftermarket ram and ssd.
- I only ran out for about two minutes, and I know these are tricky boxen…
- TLDR wow almost perfect, nightly, no wifi. I had a windows installer on USB. I put the nightly anyboot on it with “etcher”. Electron, yes, gross, but it works well.
- Plugged my haiku stick in to the laptop. Turned it on, held option key down, got a boot menu. The Mac said it was still the windows disk. Absurd! Everything else correctly identifies it - some kind of caching?
- Tried booting with EFI option. Got bored after about 60 seconds, looked like it hung. Tried again with the … Normal thing…
- Booted in seconds, painless install. (Still can’t boot Haiku through EFI atm due to SIM or whatever it is)
- Only tested webpositive before turning it off.
- No wifi, connected via Ethernet. With wired network, storage, display, mouse and keyboard working

Additional comments (multi-line):
    Preinstall Haiku 64-bit on a compatible PC, then put it inside the Mac.
    AirPort (WiFi) does not work under Haiku; Ethernet works great.
    Sound does not work; tested with speakers and audio out.
    Key and screen brightness do not work.
    Resolution was set at 1152x768.

Apple MacBook Pro 15" 2.2GHz Mid-2007 (MacBookPro3,1)
Rating: Somewhat okay (i.e. the display works, but there's no sound or mouse)
Version: Haiku R1 Beta 1 (32-bit)
Startup media: Internal SSD or hard drive (imaged or installed)
Started with: I do not know what this means
Boot options: Tried boot options
Memory: 6GB
CPU: Intel Core 2 Duo 2.2GHz (probably T7500 "Merom")
GPU: NVIDIA GeForce 8600M GT with 128MB
Additional notes (multi-line):
    Does not boot Haiku from USB, you need to use a DVD drive or extract the disk and use another computer to install Haiku onto it. In my case, I must have screwed the boot loader stuff by having two SSDs with multiple partitions, so I ended up using a secondary SSD with an Haiku R1/Beta 1 32bit install image (written using dd) to boot the system (by pressing ALT and then choosing `Windows`) and the main drive to hold the partitions for both macOS and Haiku.
    Sometimes, it requires two or three attempts before booting successfully, and turning on or off some boot options may help, but I could not find a pattern that would work every single time. Sometimes, the boot process seems to be frozen at the first icon, until I take out the cable of a USB mouse, then it boots. 
    It uses VESA Graphics on the full internal display resolution and Wifi works OK.
    Sometimes, though, it looses wifi connection and can only get back online by rebooting the system.
    Audio output did not work in the beta, but if you update to a recent (64bit) nightly build, you can get loud audio output on earphones or external speakers.
    The internal trackpad seems to be a bit ""nervous"", clicking in small targets may be a challenge, and there is no secondary button nor scroll. Using an external USB mouse worked perfectly.
    There is no iSight camera, but I believe the internal microphone works.
    Keyboard layout for my language (Portuguese) is a work in progress, as there are some keys that need to be reconfigured.
    There is no keyboard backlight. The system is very stable overall.
    I did see a few kernel panics occasionally, but I have been able to work for long hours without any problems.

    Added note for 900p per request on the Haiku forum.
    Wireless gets stuck on ‘Connecting’ after closing and opening the lid. A restart fixes it, but that's not opimal, so I'll provide any debugging help that's needed for developers.
    Right click does not work with the stock touchpad.
    Also, I have not tested the DVD drive.

Additional notes: The touchpad has software "buttons" which do not (yet) work in Haiku, so only a left click can be performed. A USB mouse should be used, but it must be plugged in before starting Haiku. Starting the Bluetooth server will cause the server to hang and the process will have to be killed. Audio works, but it must be unmuted using the keyboard. The other volume keys and the brightness keys do not work, but the volume and brightness levels can be changed from Haiku.
