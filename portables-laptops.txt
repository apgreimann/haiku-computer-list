Apple MacBook (matte black; polycarbonate MacBook1,1)
Version: Haiku R1 Beta 1 (32-bit edition)
Rating: Good (nearly everything works; e.g. the display, audio, ports, peripherals work, but no Wifi)
Startup media: Internal SSD or hard drive (imaged or installed)
Started with: Legacy BIOS/CSM
Boot options: Tried Haiku boot options
CPU: Intel Core Duo T2500 (dual-core; 32-bit)
GPU: Intel GMA 950 (64 MB shared)
Sound cards: Built-in Apple audio
Networking cards: AirPort Extreme (802.11b/g)
USB types tested: USB 2.0/legacy ports
Tested webcams: Yes, (and cams do not work on my machine)
Memory: 2 GB
SD drive and reader: My machine does not have a SD card drive or fingerprint reader
Share on GitHub: Yes
Additional notes (multi-line):
- Installed Haiku on a separate machine, then put the HD in using legacy BIOS to start.
- The little Mac works okay, but it does have a few things to note.
- On startup, Haiku stalls -- pressing a key will help fix this.
- The built-in iSight webcam and mic don't work (minor).
- Far as I can tell, brightness and audio does not work.
- The wi-fi card is detected and connects, but doesn't work well; you'll need to use Ethernet for a solid connection.
- Also, restart instead of shutting down and press power at the gray screen to avoid shutdown hanging.
- Other than that, again, it works great and I'd definitely give it a try!

  The wireless card in this machine is not a stock one, however, the stock Wifi was also Intel, and also worked just fine.
  I’m really surprised at how well this machine works, I’m really only missing out on the fingerprint reader and the camera.
  Both legacy and EFI boot just fine on this hardware, I just use EFI as everything else on this machine is also EFI.

Lenovo Z50-70
Version: Haiku R1 Beta 1 (64-bit)
Rating: Good (nearly everything works; e.g. the display, audio, ports, peripherals work, but no Wifi)

Boot options: Did not try boot options
Memory: 8 GB
CPU: Intel I7-4510U
GPU: Dual graphics (Intel Haswell and Nvidia GeForce)
Networking cards: Atheros (not sure exact model). Realtek Ethernet.
Additional notes (multi-line):
    WiFi works surprisingly well.
    In general the system works ok, screen resolution at 1920x1080 is perfect.
    Sound works well, but very unreliable microphone input (worked very poorly when run from BIOS, didn’t work at all from EFI).
    Only detects integrated Intel graphics (to be expected).
    Some erratic behaviour e.g. USB mouse stopped working randomly (had to use trackpad - two finger scrolling supported!) but worked on reboot.
    Camera not detected.
    Web browser prone to crashes.
    Uses about 1GB of RAM when browsing the web with YouTube.
    In conclusion, not too bad actually - quite impressive. This comment was uploaded from Haiku itself.
