Rating: Good (nearly everything works; e.g. the display, audio, ports, peripherals work, but no Wifi)
Startup media: Internal SSD or hard drive (imaged or installed)
Started with: EFI on (no legacy/CSM support is available on this machine)
Boot options: Tried boot options

Additional notes (multi-line):
- Had to use safe video mode to get it to boot past the splash screen.
- Ethernet and WiFi both appear to work (I'm using ethernet and it works, wifi is listing networks so assuming it's working).
- Haven't been able to test sound so it may or may not work yet.

    One slight problem is that the display would sometimes change to 8bit colour when booting and when exiting full screen applications.
    I’d like to thank my school, AlMurooj School AbuDhabi for providing me both the ThinkCentre E63z I filled out earlier (so credit them on that too plz) and the E73
