Additional_notes_pt4: "UEFI boot requires more testing, when I tried it last week it caused glitched graphics and Haiku was unusable"

Additional_notes_pt6: "The HDD of this laptop was replaced with a 250G Samsung SSD that is also recognized by DriveSetup"
Additional_notes_pt7: "The mic doesn’t seem to be working, SoundRecorder doesn’t record anything"
