Additional notes: (WiFi is not working on this computer; first test had mentioned missing Wi-Fi adapter LED light, but Wi-Fi works.)

Model: [Acer] Aspire V7-482PG
Machine_Rating: Works amazingly well
Version: Haiku R1/beta2 (quick edit, the 64-bit version)
Startup media: USB storage media (USB 2)
Startup mode: Legacy BIOS and UEFI
Boot options: Default on BIOS, 1280x1024 resolution on UEFI, the default of 1920x1080 crashes
CPU: Intel Core i5-4200U
GPU: Intel HD 4400 and Nvidia GeForce GT 750M
Sound cards: Intel (Haswell-ULT) HDA Controller
Networking cards: Intel Corporation Wireless 7260 (works, I’m using it to post this from Haiku) and Realtek RTL8111/8168/8411 PCI Express Gigabit Ethernet (not tested but should work, Haiku displays its MAC address, mine is the RTL8411B)
USB types: 1 USB 3.2, 2 USB 2.0
Webcams: Chicony Electronics HD WebCam, not recognized, not working
RAM: 8 GB DDR3
Share on GitHub: Yes
SD cards: RTL8411B PCI Express Card Reader (PCI Express link bandwidth shared with Ethernet controller), not working
Sound status: I can change the volume, sound card is recognized but sound doesn’t play
Networking status: WiFi works, Ethernet is recognized but I can’t test it
Graphics status: Work out of the box
Power status: Battery appears, PowerStatus reports percentage fine
Restart status: Works fine
Additional notes (multi-line):
- Touchpad doesn’t recognize right click (workaround: configure as 1 button touchpad and use ctrl+click to right click), edge scroll works well. The right click problem happens with other laptops too, all Synaptics touchpads, seems like a limitation in the driver
- Elan Microelectronics touch screen works! Haiku only uses the touch info to move the cursor though, I can’t find a way to click
- HDMI port not tested
- UEFI boot requires more testing, when I tried it last week it caused glitched graphics and Haiku was unusable
- The 24GB M-pcie SSD (Kingston SMS151S324G) is recognized by DriveSetup
- The HDD of this laptop was replaced with a 250G Samsung SSD that is also recognized by DriveSetup
- The mic doesn’t seem to be working, SoundRecorder doesn’t record anything
- Bluetooth works and can pair
- This laptop is a great candidate for using Haiku on real hardware if you don’t need sound or recording video

Cam status: My computer does not have a webcam, etc.
Additional notes: Offline install of optional wireless firmware did not work the conventional route, you have to install an already patched hpkg and reboot. Furthermore, despite other OSes showing the screen refresh rate locked at 60 Hz, you /can/ use Haiku at 85 Hz, which improves graphical performance in 3D rendering (as tested with the teapot), but do so at your own risk as I'm not sure if it's overclocking the screen or the screen is rated for 85 Hz and other OSes just don't detect that. Opening programs in full screen shows a blank screen that you must alt-F4 out of. The OS is generally sluggish, mostly when WebPositive is open, but works just fine as far as I can tell.
