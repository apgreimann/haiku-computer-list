Rating: Good (nearly everything works; e.g. the display, audio, ports, peripherals work, but no Wifi)
Startup media: Internal SSD or hard drive (imaged or installed)
Started with: EFI on (no legacy/CSM support is available on this machine)
Boot options: Tried boot options

Additional notes (multi-line):
- Had to use safe video mode to get it to boot past the splash screen.
- Ethernet and WiFi both appear to work (I'm using ethernet and it works, wifi is listing networks so assuming it's working).
- Haven't been able to test sound so it may or may not work yet.
