### What is this file?

This is an example of how hardware should be listed on the [Computers compatible with Haiku](https://discuss.haiku-os.org/t/computers-compatible-with-haiku-v3/7640)
thread on the Haiku forum if you opt to submit your hardware manually.

### Notes:

* For category or **form factor**, please list if your computer should be filed under:
All-in-One Desktops, General-purpose laptops/portables, Tablets/Convertibles, Notebooks,
Desktops, (Mobile) Workstations, Servers, Thin Clients, or VMs.
* For **rating**, please choose between 1 and 4, where: 1/4 means Haiku does not work on this machine,
2/4 means Haiku barely works or needs extra options to start, 3/4 means Haiku works with most of the components,
or 4/4 means Haiku works with all (or nearly all) of the components.
* Several detailed options, such as SD drive, graphics, sound, restart, and network status is optional,
and is up to you as the contributor to add or leave out. Please do include your rating, make and model, Haiku
revision, and startup mode, however.
