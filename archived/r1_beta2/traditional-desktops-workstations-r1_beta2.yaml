Machine_Rating: "B - Haiku works with most things on this computer"
Share_to_GitHub: "Yes"
Startup_media: "Built in SSD, hybrid SSHD, or traditional HDD"
Startup_mode: "CSM (or Legacy BIOS, usually in older/vintage machines)"
RAM: "4GB"

Networking_cards: "82566DM-2 Gigabit Network Connection"
Sound_cards: "82801I (ICH9 Family) HD Audio Controller"
Graphics_status: "Graphics do not work"
Sound_status: "Sound works okay"
Networking_status: "Only wired (Ethernet) works"
Restart_status: "Great - Haiku restarts smoothly"
Input_status: "Full - Trackpad/mouse and keyboard both work"
Additional_notes: "With an R5 240 video card, using a DVI to VGA adapter will result in a video mode missmatch between the monitor and video card; 'Unsupported mode' if you're unlucky. You need to use a monitor with native DVI. I haven't tested DP. The integrated Intel GPU doesn't work at all specifically with Haiku. I haven't played around with that much. The rear audio jacks have issues, front seem to work perfectly. The integrated speaker also works well. Nothing else I can think of that has issues. An HP DC5800 (with a dedicated video card) is a good option for running Haiku on bare metal."
