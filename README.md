thread on the Haiku Forum, and [the Haiku Computer List](https://www.haiku-computer-list.org/) webpage for listing submitted hardware.

To add hardware for submission, please do *not* create a pull request. Instead, please use the [hardware submission form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSceXPfiAXE4tSEDRaJo0CkTrFi3Sva6g3ZtoZUBC6oogA7PYw/viewform?usp=sf_link)
